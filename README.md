This repository wanna add annotation behaviors, such as mark, comment, like, 
confuse, to the original NCBI/PubReader repository.
With it, you can highlight text, comment in lines, and share your emotions.
To try it out, simply clone the repository to a directory on your pc:

    git clone https://github.com/xiongzhp/PubReader.git

And then, in your browser, open `PubReader/test/test-article2.html`, 
which is adapted from the original test page `PubReader/test/test-article1.html` in NCBI/PubReader repository, 
and you can see a marker bar popup if you select some text of the page.
One of the dominante bugs is that all of your markers would disappear when you just wanna delete one of them.
Hope someone would fix it.
