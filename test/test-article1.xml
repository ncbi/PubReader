            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p id="__p1">Protein interactions play a key role in life processes. Characterization of
              conformational properties of protein-protein interactions is important for
              understanding the mechanisms of protein association. The rapidly increasing amount of
              experimentally determined structures of proteins and protein-protein complexes
              provides foundation for research on protein interactions and complex formation. The
              knowledge of the conformations of the surface side chains is essential for modeling of
              protein complexes. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare dihedral angle
              distribution functions of the side chains at the interface and non-interface areas in
              bound and unbound proteins. </p>

          <div id="__sec2" class="sec">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p id="__p2">To calculate the dihedral angle distribution functions, the configuration
              space was divided into grid cells. Statistical analysis showed that the similarity
              between bound and unbound interface and non-interface surface depends on the amino
              acid type and the grid resolution. The correlation coefficients between the
              distribution functions increased with the grid spacing increase for all amino acid
              types. The Manhattan distance showing the degree of dissimilarity between the
              distribution functions decreased accordingly. Short residues with one or two dihedral
              angles had higher correlations and smaller Manhattan distances than the longer
              residues. Met and Arg had the slowest growth of the correlation coefficient with the
              grid spacing increase. The correlations between the interface and non-interface
              distribution functions had a similar dependence on the grid resolution in both bound
              and unbound states. The interface and non-interface differences between bound and
              unbound distribution functions, caused by biological protein-protein interactions or
              crystal contacts, disappeared at the 70&#x000b0; grid spacing for interfaces and
              30&#x000b0; for non-interface surface, which agrees with an average span of the
              side-chain rotamers. </p>

          <div id="__sec3" class="sec sec-last">
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p id="__p3">The two-fold difference in the critical grid spacing indicates larger
              conformational changes upon binding at the interface than at the rest of the surface.
              At the same time, transitions between rotamers induced by interactions across the
              interface or the crystal packing are rare, with most side chains having local
              readjustments that do not change the rotameric state. The analysis is important for
              better understanding of protein interactions and development of flexible docking
              approaches. </p>

        <p id="__p4">Protein-protein interactions play a key role in life processes. Characterization of
          conformational changes in proteins upon binding is important for understanding the
          mechanisms of protein association and for our ability to model it. Dependence of
          side-chain dihedral angle distribution on the conformation of the backbone has been
          investigated in earlier studies [1-5]. The side-chain dihedral angles are not evenly
          distributed, but for the most part are tightly clustered. A number of unbound rotamer
          libraries have been described previously [1-14] (see [15] for a review). Dunbrack and
          Cohen [1] used Bayesian statistics to estimate populations and dihedral angles for all
          amino acids rotamers at all <img src="assets/x03C6.gif" border="0"
            alt="[var phi]" title=""/> and &#x003c8; values. A backbone-dependent rotamer library
          [15] was obtained by dividing <img src="assets/x03C6.gif" border="0"
            alt="[var phi]" title=""/> and &#x003c8; dihedral space into 10&#x000b0;&#x000d7;<img
            src="assets/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " title=""/>10&#x000b0; bins,
          &#x003c7; angles into 120&#x000b0; bins, and calculating frequencies and average values of
          rotamers for each amino acid. A backbone-independent rotamer library was generated in a
          similar way. In a recent study [16], a new version of the backbone-dependent rotamer
          library was developed. It consists of rotamer frequencies, mean dihedral angles, and
          variances as a function of the backbone dihedral angles. In one of the latest
          backbone-independent rotamer libraries, the &#x0201c;Penultimate rotamer library&#x0201d;
          [5] by Lovell, Richardson and colleagues, the dihedral angle space was clustered and
          rotamer positions were defined as the distribution mode. </p>
        <p id="__p5">Comparison of the side-chain distribution in the core and on the surface [3],
          conducted on 19 protein structures available in 1978, revealed a small variation of the
            &#x003c7;<sub>1</sub> rotamers distribution. A later study [17] on a set of 50
          non-homologous proteins showed that for all side chains, except Asp, Asn and Glu, the
          distributions of &#x003c7;<sub>1</sub> rotamers on the surface and in the core are not
          significantly different. </p>
        <p id="__p6">Comparison of the &#x003c7;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003c7;<sub>2</sub> distributions
          at the interface and non-interface surface was performed by Guharoy et al. [18].
          Distributions were divided into bins as in the Dunbrack&#x02019;s backbone-independent
          rotamer library [1]. Empirical free energies of inter-rotamer transitions were calculated
          and compared for the interface and non-interface areas. The rotamers free energies were
          different at the interface and non-interface, whereas bound and unbound free energies were
          essentially the same. </p>
        <p id="__p7">Conformations of surface residues in protein structures determined by
          crystallography are affected by the crystal packing. The area of the protein surface
          involved in the crystal contacts is generally smaller than in biological interfaces [19],
          and the interface packing is looser [20]. Studies of the crystal packing effect on the
          surface side chains [21-23] showed that<img src="assets/x2009.gif"
            border="0" alt=" " title=""/>~<img src="assets/x2009.gif" border="0"
            alt=" " title=""/>20% of the exposed side chains change conformation, and the change
          increases with the increase of the side-chain solvent accessibility. Large polar or
          charged residues Arg, Lys, Glu, Gln, as well as Ser were found to be most flexible [21]. </p>
        <p id="__p8">The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare dihedral angle
          distribution functions of the side chains at the interface and non-interface areas in
          bound and unbound proteins. Such analysis is important for better understanding of protein
          interactions and development of flexible docking approaches. The dihedral-angle
          distribution functions (DADF) were calculated on a cubic grid dividing the dihedral space
          into cells for each residue type, at interface and non-interface surface, in bound and
          unbound structures. The correlation coefficients between bound and unbound, interface and
          non-interface DADFs were calculated, along with the Manhattan distance, as a measure of
          dissimilarity between the DADFs. All the correlation coefficients depended on the amino
          acid type and the grid resolution. The correlation coefficients always increased with the
          increase of the grid spacing, whereas the Manhattan distances decreased accordingly. Short
          residues with one or two dihedral angles had higher correlations and smaller Manhattan
          distances at small grid spacing than the longer residues. The correlation between the
          interface and non-interface DADFs showed a similar dependence on the grid resolution in
          both bound and unbound states. The differences between bound and unbound DADFs induced by
          biological protein-protein interactions or crystal contacts disappeared at the 70&#x000b0;
          grid spacing for interfaces and 30&#x000b0; for non-interface surface. The two-fold
          difference in the critical grid spacing indicates larger changes at the interface than on
          the rest of the surface. While the earlier studies [18,24,25] observed this trend for the
          side-chain rotamers, this study validates it by a more general approach based on the
          DADFs. </p>

        <p id="__p14">Side chain conformations were represented by dihedral angles, calculated by
          Dangle [28]. All dihedral angles varied from &#x02212;180&#x000b0; to 180&#x000b0;, with
          exception of the last dihedral angle in Phe, Tyr, Asp and Glu [2], which varied from
          0&#x000b0; to 180&#x000b0; due to the symmetry of the terminal aromatic and charged
          groups. To calculate the distribution functions, the configuration space was divided into
          cells by a cubic grid. </p>
        <p id="__p15">DADFs were calculated as the occupancy of the grid cells separately for each
          residue type for interface and non-interface, bound and unbound residues. Thus, there were
          four DADFs for each residue type: interface bound, interface unbound, non-interface bound,
          and non-interface unbound. Figure 1 shows a two-dimensional distribution function of Asp
          dihedral angles for the non-interface unbound residues. </p>

          >The discrete probability distribution of the amino acid side-chain &#x003c7; angles
          depended on the starting point of splitting and the size of the grid spacing. An example
          of a probability function with 20&#x000b0; grid spacing and different starting points of
          splitting for non-interface unbound Ser is shown in Figure 2. The distribution was divided
          into cells with a predefined step size, starting with a randomly chosen point, and the
          probability in each cell was calculated. To remove the effect of splitting, correlation
          coefficients were calculated 100 and 1000 times with the same splitting step but random
          starting point of splitting. Then, the average correlation coefficients were calculated.
          We found no significant difference between the correlation coefficients averaged 100 or
          1000 times. Tests of statistical significance of the correlation [31] between bound and
          unbound distributions, and non-interface and interface distributions showed that all
          correlation values were significant, with p-values far below 0.001. </p>

          cells yielded more smooth/similar distributions). Table shows the grid spacing at which
          the correlation reaches a high level of 0.7. Most amino acids had high correlation between

          reached the high level of 0.7 at the 70&#x000b0; grid spacing for interface, and
          30&#x000b0; for non-interface. The two-fold difference in the critical grid spacing
          indicates higher flexibility of these amino acids at the interface [24]. Since the
          120&#x000b0; distance between two adjacent side-chain rotamers is significantly larger
          than the critical grid spacing, the use of large clustering radii for bound and unbound
          rotamer libraries [24] would produce similar results. </p>

          />2 was used to calculate the Manhattan distance between bound and unbound
          interface/non-interface distributions. As in the case of correlation, the metric value
          depended on the grid spacing, with larger steps corresponding to more coarse-grained
          distributions. Thus, tests were conducted with different steps: 10&#x000b0;, 30&#x000b0;,
          50&#x000b0;, 70&#x000b0;, and 90&#x000b0;. The distance between the distributions
          decreased with the step increase (Figure 4). In most cases, the Manhattan distances for
          the interface were greater than for the non-interface. The distances between interface
          unbound and bound distributions for all long amino acids with three and four dihedral
          angles were the largest (Figure 4A). It agrees with our previous findings that long amino
          acids have higher flexibility in binding [24]. The Manhattan distance between the
          probability functions was<img src="assets/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" "

            title=""/>30% for most amino acids, starting with 50&#x000b0; grid spacing, except for
          Met and Arg interface bound vs. unbound and non-interface vs. interface distributions. For
          these distributions, the distance was<img src="assets/x2009.gif" border="0"

            border="0" alt=" " title=""/>35% for Met interface bound vs. unbound and Arg bound
          non-interface vs. interface. The high similarity between the DADFs at the 50&#x000b0; grid
          spacing is a result of the small number of rotamer-to-rotamer transitions induced by
          interactions across the interface or the crystal packing. Most side chains have local
          readjustments (Figure 5) that do not change the rotameric state. </p>

        <h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="__sec7title">Conclusions</h2><p id="__p34">The
          dihedral-angle distribution functions were calculated for each amino acid type for
          interface and non-interface surface residues, in bound and unbound protein structures. To
          generate the distribution functions, the configuration space was divided into cells by a
          cubic grid. Correlation coefficients between bound and unbound interface and non-interface
          distribution functions were calculated. The similarity between the distributions was also
          quantified by the Manhattan distance. The results showed that all the correlation
          coefficients depend on amino acid type and the grid resolution. For all amino acid types,
          the correlation coefficients increased with the increase of the grid spacing. The
          Manhattan distances between the distribution functions decreased accordingly. Short
          residues with one or two dihedral angles had higher correlations and smaller Manhattan
          distances than the longer residues. Met and Arg had the lowest correlation coefficients at
          any grid spacing. The correlations between the interface and non-interface distribution
          functions had a similar dependence on the grid resolution in both bound and unbound
          states. The interface and non-interface difference between bound and unbound distribution
          functions, induced by biological protein-protein interactions or crystal contacts,
          disappeared at the 70&#x000b0; grid spacing for interfaces and 30&#x000b0; for
          non-interface surface, in agreement with an average span of a side-chain rotamer. The
          two-fold difference in the critical grid spacing indicates larger conformational changes
          upon binding at the interface than at the rest of the surface. At the same time,
          transitions between rotamers induced by interactions across the interface or the crystal
          packing are rare, with most side chains having local readjustments that do not change the
          rotameric state. </p>
        <p id="__p35">Conformational sampling based on the side chain dihedral angle distributions
          may optimize flexible docking protocols by reflecting conformational preferences of the
          bound proteins. The results suggest that the site- (interface vs. non-interface) and
          residue-specific grid spacing smaller than the critical values should be used in the
          sampling. The minimal grid spacing (Table ) reflects intra-rotamer amino acid local
          readjustments upon binding. Thus, using such steps in conformational sampling may
          accelerate the flexible docking search by reflecting the size of these readjustments. </p>
